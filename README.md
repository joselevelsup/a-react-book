# A Simple React Book

No this is not really a book. This is more like a resource repo to help the Fellows at TKH who are learning react to have another resource with code examples and explanations.

It starts at the Intro to React Folder. This repo covers

- JSX and React
- Components (Both Class and Function)
- Props
- Events
- State and Lifecycle
- Hooks
- Routing (Mostly SPA) (Coming soon)
- UI/Utility Frameworks (Chakra UI, Bootstrap, Material UI, TailwindCSS) (Coming soon)
- Server Side Rendering using Next.js (Coming soon)
- Comparison to Other Front End Libraries (Coming soon)
